# Code Forge IDE
# Welcome to Code Forge

**Code Forge** is a community-driven project with an ambitious goal:  
to build a comprehensive, high-performance, and fully open-source solution for cross-platform development using **.NET**.

This project is still in its **early stages**—we’re laying the foundation for a modular and extensible IDE that aims to serve as a fast, modern environment for .NET developers across all platforms.

> ⚠️ Please note: The IDE is currently **not ready for real-world use**. Many core features are under active development, and the project is in a **proof-of-concept** phase. We're exploring the architecture, experimenting with design ideas, and building the groundwork for something great.

Despite its early state, we believe in the power of **open collaboration**.  
If you're excited by the idea of helping shape a new development tool from the ground up, this is a great time to get involved!

Whether you're contributing code, reporting issues, writing documentation, or simply sharing ideas—we'd love to have you on board.

> 💡 Every contribution counts. Your insights and skills can help drive Code Forge forward.

**Join us** and help build the future of cross-platform development with .NET.
